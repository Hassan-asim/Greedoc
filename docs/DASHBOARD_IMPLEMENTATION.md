# Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

The Doctor Dashboard now displays real-time statistics from Firebase instead of hardcoded values. The dashboard shows:

1. **Total Patients** - Count of all patients assigned to the doctor
2. **Active Patients** - Count of patients with active status
3. **Pending Reports** - Count of health records with pending/under_review status
4. **Today's Appointments** - Count of appointments scheduled for today

## Backend Implementation

### Dashboard Controller (`server/controllers/dashboardController.js`)

- `getDashboardStats(doctorId)` - Returns all dashboard statistics
- `getPatientStats(doctorId)` - Returns patient statistics
- `getReportStats(doctorId)` - Returns report statistics
- `getAppointmentStats(doctorId)` - Returns appointment statistics

### Dashboard Routes (`server/routes/dashboard.js`)

- `GET /api/dashboard/stats/:doctorId` - Get all dashboard stats
- `GET /api/dashboard/patients/:doctorId` - Get patient stats
- `GET /api/dashboard/reports/:doctorId` - Get report stats
- `GET /api/dashboard/appointments/:doctorId` - Get appointment stats

## Frontend Implementation

### Dashboard Service (`client/src/services/dashboardService.ts`)

- `getDashboardStats(doctorId)` - Fetch all dashboard statistics
- `getPatientStats(doctorId)` - Fetch patient statistics
- `getReportStats(doctorId)` - Fetch report statistics
- `getAppointmentStats(doctorId)` - Fetch appointment statistics

### Doctor Dashboard (`client/src/pages/DoctorDashboard.tsx`)

- Real-time statistics display with loading states
- Automatic refresh when new patients are added
- Manual refresh button for manual data updates
- Error handling with fallback to default values

## Data Sources

### Total Patients

- Queries `users` collection where `role = "patient"` and `doctorId = doctorId`
- Counts all patients assigned to the doctor

### Active Patients

- Queries `users` collection where `role = "patient"`, `doctorId = doctorId`, and `isActive = true`
- Excludes patients with `status = "pending"` or `isActive = false`

### Pending Reports

- Queries `healthRecords` collection for patients assigned to the doctor
- Counts records with `status = "pending"` or `status = "under_review"`

### Today's Appointments

- Queries `appointments` collection where `doctorId = doctorId`
- Filters appointments by today's date range
- Uses Firestore Timestamp comparison for accurate date filtering

## Features

### Loading States

- Skeleton loading animations while fetching data
- Disabled refresh button during loading
- Graceful error handling with toast notifications

### Real-time Updates

- Dashboard stats refresh automatically when new patients are added
- Manual refresh button for on-demand updates
- Optimistic UI updates with error rollback

### Error Handling

- Network error handling with user-friendly messages
- Fallback to default values (0) on API failures
- Console logging for debugging

## Usage

1. **Automatic Loading**: Dashboard stats load automatically when the doctor logs in
2. **Manual Refresh**: Click the "Refresh" button to reload all statistics
3. **Real-time Updates**: Stats update automatically when patients are added
4. **Error Recovery**: If API calls fail, the dashboard shows default values and allows retry

## API Endpoints

```
GET /api/dashboard/stats/:doctorId
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: {
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "totalPatients": 25,
    "activePatients": 20,
    "pendingReports": 3,
    "todayAppointments": 5
  }
}
```

## Security

- All endpoints require authentication
- Doctors can only access their own statistics
- User ID validation ensures data isolation
- JWT token verification on all requests
